# Jasmin Postman Samples
Here you can find a collection to use in [**Postman application**](https://www.getpostman.com/) with some useful samples of how to use the Jasmin API.

The collection uses some variables that are defined in the [**JASMIN Environment**](JASMIN%20Environment.postman_environment.json) which you must set with your own values.
